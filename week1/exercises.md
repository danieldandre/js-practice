## Day 2

### Exercise 1
#### What is the difference between Null & Undefined types in Javascript? 

Answer: undefined stands for both value and type while null is for values only

### Exercise 2: Array Manipulation
#### Exercise 2.1 - Can an array contain other arrays? What data types can you store in an array? 

Answer: Yes. All of them.

#### Exercise 2.2

a) How do you index an array? 
    []

b) How do you access the last value of an array? 
    [i], where 0 is the firs position

c) How do you access each second value in an array? 
    day2.js

d) How do you access every element except the first value of an array? 
    Using a for lop but "i = 1" which means it's skipping the first element

#### Exercise 2.3

Show me example code employing each of the following methods: .pop, .push, .shift, .unshift
    day2.js

#### Exercise 2.4

Show me example code on how to use .map, .filter, .find, .includes and .indexOf.

#### Exercise 2.5 (Bonus)

Create an 8×8 “checkerboard” array where the value is 0 on every even square and 1 on every odd square. Use only vanilla JavaScript array methods—no external libraries.

Your checkerboard pattern should be visible by calling console.log(your_array). 


## Day 3

### Exercise 1 - Loops
#### Exercise 1.1 - What is a loop? Explain in the simplest way possible. 

Answer: A loop is a strcuture of code that repeats itself until certain conditions are met

#### Exercise 1.2 - What does a `for loop` do? Explain succinctly and create a code example.

Answer: A for-loop runs a block od code a specific number of times, its usually in the format of: for (let i = 0; i < N; i++), N being the number of times the block will repeat itself and i the index that updates with i++ and eventually halts when the condition i < N is met.

#### Exercise 1.3 - What does a `while loop` do? Explain succinctly and create a code example.

Answer:A while-loop runs a block of code while a condtion remains true. Example on Day3.js.

#### Exercise 1.4 - What does a `for...of` loop do? Explain succinctly and create a code example.

Answer: A for-of loop iterates directly on the values of any iterable such as arrays, strings and others.

#### Exercise 1.5 - What does a `for...in` loop do? Explain succinctly and create a code example.

Answer: A for-in loop covers all the properties of an object. v

### Exercise 2

Create an array for 0 -> 10. Loop over it and return only even numbers. 

### Exercise 3

Generate an array with random numbers of potentially random size. Loop through that array and return the largest number. 
Hint: Use [this](https://www.30secondsofcode.org/js/s/random-integer-array-in-range/#:~:text=You%20can%20use%20Array.,()%20to%20make%20them%20integers.)

### Exercise 4

Modify the previous exercise to print/log the highest number and the position in the array. Example in day3.js example.

### Exercise 5

`{name: "Jane", age: 25}`

Loop over the above structure and print each value as "key: "value". Choose the appropriate loop. Example in day3.js example.
